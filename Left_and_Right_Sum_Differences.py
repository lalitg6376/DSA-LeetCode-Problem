# Define two arrays leftSum and rightSum where:
# leftSum[i] is the sum of elements to the left of the index i in the array nums. If there is no such element, leftSum[i] = 0.
# rightSum[i] is the sum of elements to the right of the index i in the array nums. If there is no such element, rightSum[i] = 0.
# Return an integer array answer of size n where answer[i] = |leftSum[i] - rightSum[i]|.
